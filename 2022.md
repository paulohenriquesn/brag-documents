## Projects

*September 2022*
[Blocks Revit Backend Refactoring: Express Instead of Nest.js but... Why?]
> Since I came to Blocks I realized that our backend was a big mess!
> We didn't have good practices on our code, was It our guilty? yeah!
> When I came, the main task was to finish the MVP but our time was little a lot.
> Ok, I understand but... continuing coding in this backend without refactoring or making any test (yeah we didnt make any test) was definitely our guilty, for this reason I came to my terminal and typed "rm -rf backend/*", with this I started a new project but Why I decided to use express instead of nest.js? I really like Nest.js It but I think it forces you to write in Nestjs' pattern, I really like to improve my skills and change my backend architecture with time, ok modules is so good but you don't need forces me to use it haha!
> I decided to use express but now my backend is totally independent of frameworks, I started my project using rules of clean architecture and solid principles with this changes I think that Blocks can be mature more.

 [Blocks Revit Backend Refactoring to Microservices]
> It was a long time on my job that I was sad with the backend architecture that we had, was it bad? It was,
> First of all let me show you about the company, Blocks is a plugin made to help users to download 3d models for Revit more easily, the architecture is very simple it just a CRUD where the user can download the plugin and acess a list of 3d models and use them, ok but what was the problem with Backend? everything.
> We had just one simple monolhitic backend that your responsability it was: take care of payments, user registers, list 3d models, socket behaviour etc...
> Don't you think that is a lot of behaviours for a unique backend? yeah I really think too.
> Because of it I decided to split this backend in microservices ;) so now we got 2 micro backends that every backend has one behaviour like user service (to auth user and take care of payments), plugin service (to take care about crud plugin core) with this if plugin service take down for some reason our company will be able to continue selling without interruptions.

 [Blocks Revit Backend Adding Cache on Endpoints]
> I've added cache management for my endpoints, and I will tell you the reason for it,
> I was thinking about how I could reduce my requests endpoints time by half because here on Blocks we have a lot of endpoints that no change the result, So...
> If you have a GET endpoint that no changes the result, why you don't cache it? yeah it's what I did!
> I cached the GET results with a TTL for 10 minutes, So if the user reach the endpoint It will create a cache for all others users that will revalidate after 10 minutes.
> The time response that was 800ms/700ms now is 50ms/ 40ms!

 *December 2022*
 [Blocks Revit How I Reduced 50% of custs on Digital Ocean's spaces]
> One thing that us on Blocks was suffering is the custs of Digital Ocean Spaces, 
> We were paying among 300$ with digital ocean's spaces transfers custs, So I decided to change it
> What did I do to change this situation ? 
> I cached the GET results images as blob, So if the user get the images on first load It will create a cache blob for that image and on next get from that image it will returns from blob instead of space.
